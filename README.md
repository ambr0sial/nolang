  noLang is the ultimate programming language that does nothing, and it does it perfectly.
</p>

## ‚ú® Features

- **Perfection:** noLang excels at doing absolutely nothing. You don't trust us? Write code, and see what happens! (nothing)

- **Minimalistic Syntax:** While writing noLang, my idea was to make a minimalistic syntax. It recognizes only identifiers (variable names) but doesn't do anything with them.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with noLang, follow these simple steps:

1. Install Python if you haven't already.

2. Install the `sly` library using pip:
```shell

3. Clone this repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ambr0sial/nolang.git

4. Run the noLang interpreter:
